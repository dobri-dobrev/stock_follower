# Basic example of using React with Browserify and Python

Run `sudo npm install` in the directory to install React, Browserify, and others from npm. If you get an EMFILE error, try adding ulimit -n 2560 to your .bashrc

Next, run 'npm run-script build'  
Next, run 'npm start'  
Open the browser and go to 'http://localhost:8000' or whichever port the python server started on
